## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This API uses your Google credentials to create an Oauth Object which returns an url for authentication`(/url)`. After authentication the URL redirect back to localhost which is captured and then processed to generate a token that is returned. 

Using that token, we can set credentials in an Oauth Client `(/auth)` using which we can then use the calendar API to create events using form data in JSON payload.

Every time an event is created in Google Calendar it is assigned an Meet Link automatically. That meet id can be fetched to create meet sessions as per need.

While adding events to Google Calendar other attendees can be also added thus enabling users to implement large scale group meetings by directly putting the events in the attendees calendars.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

In order to use this API we need to generate Google credentials for calendar with Scope as a web app. 

After you have received your credentials you need to change the last item that is "redirect_uris" to **["http://localhost:3000/auth"]** so that when the authorisation is successful, google redirects to the localhost so that we can capture the access token and generated an oauth token.

### Prerequisites

Generate credentials.json for google calender using Google API Dashboard.

```
credentials.json
```

### Installing

Follow the following steps to get a development env running.

First step will be to 

```
npm install
```

And then execute

```
npm run dev
```
